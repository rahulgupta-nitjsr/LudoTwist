## 2. Game Mechanics

Ludotwist follows the standard rules of Ludo, a race game where 2 to 4 players compete to move their pieces from the starting area to the central home triangle.

### 2.1. Board Layout

- **Shape**: Cross-shaped board with four colored arms (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).  
- **Spaces**:  
  - **Main Path**: 52 spaces forming a loop around the board.  
  - **Starting Area**: Each player has a triangular zone with 4 spaces to hold their pieces initially.  
  - **Home Stretch**: 5 colored spaces per player leading from the main path to the center.  
  - **Home Triangle**: Central area where all pieces must reach to win.  
- **Safe Spaces**: Specific marked spaces (e.g., starred spaces) where pieces are immune to capture.

### 2.2. Players and Pieces

- **Players**: 2 to 4 (human players or AI opponents).  
- **Pieces**: Each player controls 4 pieces, colored to match their arm of the board (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).

### 2.3. Turn Structure

- **Turn Order**: Proceeds clockwise, starting with a randomly selected player.  
- **Dice Roll**: Single six-sided die (values 1–6).  
- **Movement Rules**:  
  - A roll of 6 is required to move a piece from the starting area to the main path (entry point).  
  - Move a piece forward along the path by the number rolled.  
  - Rolling a 6 grants an extra turn.  
- **No Move Available**: If no legal moves can be made (e.g., all pieces are in the starting area and no 6 is rolled), the turn ends.

### 2.4. Capturing

- **Capture Mechanic**: If a player lands on a space occupied by an opponent’s piece (except on safe spaces), the opponent’s piece is sent back to their starting area.  
- **Safe Spaces**: Pieces on these spaces cannot be captured.

### 2.5. Winning Condition

- **Goal**: The first player to move all 4 of their pieces into the home triangle wins.  
- **Exact Roll Requirement**: Players must roll the exact number needed to land in the home triangle (e.g., if a piece is 3 spaces away, a roll of 3 is required).

## 3. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)

The UI is designed to be intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

### 3.1. Main Menu

- **Play Button**: Initiates game setup (select number of players and mode).  
- **Settings**: Options for sound volume, music toggle, language selection, and fullscreen mode.  
- **Help/Rules**: A brief guide explaining Ludo rules for new players.

### 3.2. Game Screen

- **Board Display**: Centered on the screen, scalable to fit various resolutions.  
- **Dice Area**: Positioned in the bottom-right corner, featuring a “Roll” button and dice animation.  
- **Player Indicators**: Visual cues (e.g., highlighted borders or arrows) to show the active player.

### 3.3. Controls

- **Dice Roll**: Players tap/click the “Roll” button or press the spacebar to roll the die.  
- **Piece Movement**: After rolling, eligible pieces are highlighted; players tap/click a piece to move it.

## 4. Visual and Audio Design

- **Visual Style**: Bright, clean, and colorful assets optimized for scalability and clarity.  
  - Board: High-contrast colors for each arm (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).  
  - Pieces: Simple, distinct shapes (e.g., circles or pawns) in matching colors.  
- **Audio**:  
  - **Sound Effects**: Dice roll, piece movement, capture (optional, toggleable).  
  - **Background Music**: Light, cheerful track (optional, toggleable).

## 5. Single-Player Mode

- **AI Opponents**: Basic AI to simulate human players.  
- **AI Behavior**:  
  - Prioritizes moving a piece out of the starting area with a 6.  
  - Targets capturing opponent pieces when possible.  
  - Advances pieces closest to the home stretch otherwise.

---

## 6. Local Multiplayer Mode

- **Pass-and-Play**: Players share a single device.  
- **Implementation**:  
  - Clear turn indicators (e.g., “Player 1’s Turn” with color coding).  
  - No network functionality required; all logic is local.

---

## 7. Performance and Compatibility

- **Optimization**:  
  - Compressed image assets for fast loading.  
  - Lightweight animations to maintain smooth performance.  
- **Browser Support**: Compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts layout for desktop (larger screens) and mobile (touch-friendly controls).

---

## 8. Deployment

- **Hosting**: Deployed on a web server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).  
- **URL**: Placeholder domain like `ludotwist.com` or a development subdomain.  
- **Access**: Publicly accessible via any supported browser.
