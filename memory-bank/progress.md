# Project Progress

## Step 1: Project Setup (✅ Completed and Validated)
- Created new React TypeScript project using Create React App
- Installed required dependencies:
  - styled-components (for styling)
  - react-router-dom (for routing)
  - TypeScript type definitions
  - Testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)
- Set up project directory structure:
  - src/components/ (for UI components)
  - src/game/ (for game logic)
  - src/contexts/ (for state management)
  - src/hooks/ (for custom hooks)
  - src/utils/ (for utility functions)
  - src/assets/ (for static assets)
  - src/types/ (for TypeScript interfaces)
  - src/tests/ (for test files)
- ✅ Verified development server starts successfully
- ✅ All initial tests passing

## Current Status
- Development server running at localhost:3000
- Project structure ready for component development
- All dependencies installed and working
- Test environment configured and validated
- Architecture documentation completed
- Initial test suite passing

## Validation Steps Completed
1. Project Creation:
   - ✅ Create React App with TypeScript template
   - ✅ Directory structure verification
   - ✅ Package.json configuration
2. Dependencies:
   - ✅ All required packages installed
   - ✅ TypeScript types available
   - ✅ No conflicting dependencies
3. Development Environment:
   - ✅ Development server running
   - ✅ Hot reload working
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
4. Testing Setup:
   - ✅ Jest configured
   - ✅ React Testing Library available
   - ✅ Initial test passing

## Next Steps
1. Step 2: Implement Main Menu UI
   - Create MainMenu component:
     - Implement basic layout structure
     - Add styled-components for UI elements
     - Create responsive design
   - Set up routing configuration:
     - Configure BrowserRouter
     - Define routes for all game screens
     - Implement navigation guards
   - Style menu buttons and layout:
     - Design consistent button theme
     - Implement hover and click effects
     - Ensure accessibility standards
   - Add navigation functionality:
     - Handle route transitions
     - Implement menu interactions
     - Add loading states

## Technical Debt
- Update to latest package versions when stable
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement proper TypeScript strict mode
- Set up continuous integration

## Notes
- Using TypeScript template for better type safety
- All required dependencies installed successfully
- Directory structure ready for modular development
- Test environment working correctly
- Architecture documentation up to date
- Ready to begin UI implementation
